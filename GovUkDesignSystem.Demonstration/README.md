This project contains a website that demonstrates how to use the design system components.

## Running

The simplest way to get the website running is:

- `npm install`
- Open and run the project in an IDE

## Creating this demonstration site

This would be a reasonable starting point for creating a new GovUk styled site.

- Create a new ASP.Net Core Web App with MVC project
- Create a page layout using https://design-system.service.gov.uk/styles/page-template/
- Install GOV.UK Frontend using npm: https://frontend.design-system.service.gov.uk/installing-with-npm/
- Follow https://frontend.design-system.service.gov.uk/get-started and also add a custom build target to build the SASS using npm
- Install html5shiv from npm as per https://frontend.design-system.service.gov.uk/supporting-ie8
